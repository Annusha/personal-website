My keypoint detection algorithm from the DeeperCut paper and [its implementation](https://github.com/eldar/pose-tensorflow) served as the foundation for [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut), a toolbox for studying motor behavior of animals in the lab setting developed by neuroscientists at the Universities of TÃ¼bingen and Harvard. The toolbox gained significant popularity and is now used in hundreds of labs for a variety of tracking tasks. It is discussed in the corresponding [Nature Neuroscience paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y.epdf) and was covered in the popular media such as [The Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/08/an-open-source-ai-tool-available-to-study-movement-across-behaviors-and-species/) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/deeplabcut-tracking-animal-movements/564338).

## Multi-person Body Pose Estimation demo at ECCV 2016

We gave a real-time demonstration of our Multi-person Body Pose Estimation algorithm at [ECCV 2016](http://www.eccv2016.org/main-conference/).
