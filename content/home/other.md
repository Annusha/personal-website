My [keypoint detection algorithm](https://github.com/eldar/pose-tensorflow) from the DeeperCut paper served as the foundation for [DeepLabCut](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut), a toolbox for studying the behavior of animals in the lab setting developed by neuroscientists at the Universities of TÃ¼bingen and Harvard. The toolbox gained significant popularity and is now used in more than 50 labs for a variety of tracking tasks. It is discussed in the corresponding [Nature Neuroscience paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y.epdf) and was covered in the [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41684-018-0164-y) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/deeplabcut-tracking-animal-movements/564338).
